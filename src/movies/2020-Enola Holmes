When Enola Holmes-Sherlock's teen sister-discovers her mother missing, she sets off to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy around a mysterious young Lord.
This movie is not only very interactive with its viewers, it is breathtaking. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan then this is a must watch.
